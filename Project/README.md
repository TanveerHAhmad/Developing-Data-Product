# Instructions to use the Application

 1. Clone the code using 'git clone
        "https://github.com/TanveerHAhmad/Developing-Data-Products
               /Project.git to YOUR DIRECTORY"
               
 2. Load the RStudio, Devtools, Rsconnect, Shinyapps & Knitr
 
    Note: On Windows - please make sure that you have compatable version RTOOLS & R on your computer:
    R3.2.2 for Windows(32/64 bit) from http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows and

    While installing R and Rtools change the Path from C:\Program files\R\R-3.2.2 to C:\R\R-3.2.2
